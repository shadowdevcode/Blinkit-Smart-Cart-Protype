# Smart Repeat Cart - An AI-Powered Grocery Refill Prototype

Inspired by the efficiency of services like **Blinkit**, this project is a functional prototype of an AI-powered "Smart Repeat Cart." It demonstrates how to leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) like the Google Gemini API to solve a common user friction point in e-commerce: the tedious task of rebuilding a weekly grocery cart.

## The Vision: A GPM Perspective

### The Problem: The Chore of the Repeat Purchase

In the fast-paced world of online grocery, speed is everything. While delivery can be in minutes, the user experience of *placing an order* remains a significant point of friction. For high-frequency "power users"‚Äîour most valuable customer segment‚Äîrebuilding a cart with the same 10-15 weekly staples is a repetitive, low-value task. This cognitive load leads to user drop-off, smaller basket sizes, and a diminished overall experience.

### The Opportunity: From Chore to Delight

What if we could eliminate this friction entirely? By leveraging the rich data of a user's purchase history, we can transform cart-building from a manual chore into an intelligent, one-tap "refill" experience.

The **Smart Repeat Cart** is our strategic initiative to deepen user engagement and build a powerful, personalized moat around our service.

### Business Goals:
*   **Increase 7-Day Retention:** Make re-ordering so effortless that it becomes a weekly habit.
*   **Boost Order Frequency & LTV:** By removing the primary barrier to placing an order, we encourage more frequent, smaller top-up shops in addition to the main weekly one.
*   **Enhance Personalization:** Move from a generic storefront to a service that truly understands and anticipates a user's needs.

## The User Flow: A Step-by-Step Journey

This prototype simulates the complete end-to-end experience for the user.

### Step 1: AI-Powered Prediction & Data Simulation

1.  **App Launch:** On loading, the application first calls the Gemini API to **simulate a realistic purchase history** for a typical user in India. This generates the last four weekly orders with common household items.
2.  **Prediction Request:** This generated history is immediately sent back to the Gemini API with a second, more complex prompt.
3.  **Intelligent Analysis:** The prompt instructs the AI to analyze the purchase history for frequency, recency, and common quantities to predict the user's *next* logical shopping cart.
4.  **Dynamic Scenarios:** To ensure the UI is robust, the AI is also instructed to inject real-world complexities into its prediction:
    *   It will mark one item as **'OUT_OF_STOCK'**.
    *   It will alter the price of another item and provide its **'previousPrice'** to simulate a price change.

### Step 2: The Direct & Actionable Smart Cart

The user is immediately presented with a fully populated, editable cart. **There are no intermediate summary screens or extra clicks.** This "Speed First" principle is core to the experience.

The UI clearly communicates key information:
*   **Out-of-Stock Items:** Are visually distinct (greyed out) and non-interactive, with a clear "Temporarily Unavailable" badge and a "Substitute" button.
*   **Price Changes:** Items with a new price feature a small red (increase) or green (decrease) arrow, showing the previous price for full transparency.
*   **Effortless Editing:** Users can instantly adjust quantities or remove items with a single tap.

### Step 3: Training the Model (User Feedback)

User interaction is the most valuable data source for refining the AI model.
*   **"Do Not Repeat":** A toggle on each item allows the user to tell the AI, "Don't suggest this to me again," providing powerful negative feedback.
*   **Overall Accuracy:** A simple **üëç/üëé** prompt at the bottom asks if the prediction was helpful.
*   **Granular Feedback:** If a user selects üëé, a modal appears asking for a quick, one-tap reason (e.g., "Already have this," "Wrong item"). This qualitative data is invaluable for improving the prediction logic.

### Step 4: Seamless Additions & Checkout

*   **"Add from Regulars":** Below the main cart, a horizontally scrolling list shows other frequently purchased items that weren't included in this prediction, allowing for quick, discovery-free additions.
*   **Sticky Checkout:** A persistent footer always displays the live-updating total and a prominent "Place Order" button, ensuring the path to conversion is always visible.

## Technical Stack

*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for robust, type-safe components.
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS for rapid, utility-first UI development.
*   **AI Engine:** The [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`gemini-2.5-flash` model) is used for both data simulation and predictive logic.
*   **Module Loading:** The app uses modern `importmap` for browser-native ES module imports without a build step.

## Running The Project

This project is designed to be run in an environment where the Gemini API key is securely managed as an environment variable.

### Prerequisites
*   A modern web browser that supports `importmap` (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
*   A valid Google Gemini API key.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
2.  **Configure API Key:**
    The application is hard-coded to look for the API key in `process.env.API_KEY`. In a cloud development environment or during deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify), you must set this as a secret environment variable.

    For **local development**, you will need a local server that can inject environment variables, such as `vite`.
    *   Install `vite`: `npm install -g vite`
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   Add your API key to the `.env` file:
        ```
        VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   *Important:* You would then need to modify `geminiService.ts` to read `import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY` instead of `process.env.API_KEY`. The current code is optimized for a server-side rendering or protected browser environment.

3.  **Serve the Application:**
    You can use any simple static file server. A common choice is `http-server`:
    ```bash
    # Install if you don't have it
    npm install -g http-server

    # Run from the project root
    http-server .
    ```
    Now, open your browser and navigate to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
